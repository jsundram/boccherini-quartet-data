      "notes": "THREE QUARTETS (nos. 7 to 9) for clarinet, flute, horn and bassoon. Arrangements by Othon Van den Broek. No. 1. Quartet in F Major: Allegro moderato\u2014Andante\u2014Rondo. No. 2. Quartet in C Major: Allegro moderato\u2014Andantino\u2014Rondo. No. 3. Quartet in D Minor: Allegro maestoso\u2014Andante con variazioni\u2014Tempo di minuetto (trio). None of these movements corresponds to any movement of a known work by Boccherini. It is impossible to reach any conclusion as to the origin of these arrangements. Were they derived by Van den Broek from manuscripts or editions of works by Boccherini\u2014or falsely attributed to Boccherini\u2014which are unknown to us? Or did he perhaps wish to give the prestige of Boccherini's name to works of his own production? In any case, it may be remarked that the musical value of this third collection is very inferior to that of the two preceding books (Nos. 262 and 263)."
