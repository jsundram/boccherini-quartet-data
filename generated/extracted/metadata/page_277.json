The tradition that close relations existed between Haydn and Boccherini is discussed in the Biography (p. 45). With regard to the present MS. we have consulted two scholars with a special knowledge of Haydn, Messrs. Anthony van Hoboken and Karl Geiringer. The opinion of both is that the handwriting of the score of these six quartets, though very similar to that of Haydn, is not his nor that of any of his regular amanuenses. Moreover, there is no known instance of Haydn having arranged a series of works by another musician, even a friend. Whoever transcribed the score appears to have added certain words (though not the note quoted above) in English, and we are inclined to believe that the arrangements are the work of an English amateur of the beginning of the 19th century. Unpublished."
