It appears that Boyer-Naderman published two books of three quartets for flute, violin, viola and 'cello, but no copy of this edition has been found. We can only refer to the comment of Picquot (p. 142): 'The early quartets of Boccherini have furnished the framework for these works without merit, in which a flute part has been substituted, by way of transposition, for the part of the first violin. This completely distorts the character and effect of the works'."
