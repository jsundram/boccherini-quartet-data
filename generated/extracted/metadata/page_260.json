  "partial_notes": "This page contains catalog entry [234] for STRING QUARTETS but focuses on publication history and editorial commentary rather than individual quartet entries. The page discusses Pleyel's Op. 39 publication from 1798 which contained quartets originally composed by Boccherini between 1780-1795. It provides a cross-reference table showing Pleyel Op. 39 no. 1 = Op. 52 no. 3 of 1795 (No. 234), Pleyel Op. 39 no. 2 = Op. 52 no. 1 of 1780 (No. 201), and Pleyel Op. 39 no. 3 = Op. 52 no. 3 of 1780 (No. 203). No individual quartet details with movements, keys, or incipits are provided on this page."
