      "notes": "The same quartet begins with a Largo. I presume that the Largo is merely a brief introduction which was suppressed when the work was engraved, without anything being put in its place. The MS. at Lucca (D.I.33) confirms the hypothesis put forward by Picquot. The Allegro assai is certainly by Boccherini, and it is preceded by a Largo of ten bars. A conscientious performance of this quartet should therefore take account of this MS. and not merely play the text of the V\u00e9nier edition, which deprives the work of a lyrical episode forming a natural prelude to the feverish Allegro of the first movement."
