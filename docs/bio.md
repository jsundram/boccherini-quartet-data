"""

The creative career of the composer spans the years from the late
1750s to 1804 and can be divided into five periods. The first period
includes the “Early Works”, those written in Lucca, Vienna or Paris, or
during the first years in Madrid, before the composer entered into the
service of the Spanish Infante Don Luis de Borbón. As far as works with
opus numbers—that is, chamber music and orchestral works—are con-
cerned, Opus 1 to 9 belong to this period, written in the decade 1760-1770.
They were published in Paris in various editions from 1767 onwards with
opus numbers assigned to them by their publishers among whom Jean-
Baptiste Venier is certainly the most important. In this period Boccherini
also wrote vocal music, most often sacred, as well as sonatas and con-
certos for his favourite instrument, the violoncello, but these compositions
remained—apart from four cello concertos published by the Bureau
d’Abonnement Musical in Paris—unpublished and did not receive an opus
number, neither from the composer nor from their publisher.

The Second Period includes the works written from 1771 to 1776 in
the service of the Infante Don Luis and published shortly afterwards in
Paris, by publishers such as Venier, Louis-Balthasard de La Chevardière
and Jean-Georges Sieber. Opus 10 to 24 belong to this period. The Third
Period includes the works written in the service of the Infante but no
longer published in Paris soon after their composition. These works were
written in the years 1778-1784. Opus 24 to 36 belong to this period. Some
were published by the Artaria firm in Vienna or by Antonio Zatta in
Venice, others in Paris, but the latter ones only much later.
The Fourth Period includes the works that were written for the Prus-
sian King Frederick William II, in the years 1786-1797. They were sent to
Berlin in monthly instalments. Opus 37 to 56 belong to this period.
Several of these works were published in Paris by Ignace Pleyel from 1798
onwards.

And finally there is the Fifth Period, that of the “Late Works”, those
written during the years 1798-1804, after Boccherini’s service for the
Prussian King had ended. Opus 57 to 64 fall in this period.
